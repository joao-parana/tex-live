abstract = "It is clear that the learning speed of feedforward neural networks is in general far slower than required and it has been a major bottleneck in their applications for past decades. Two key reasons behind may be: (1) the slow gradient-based learning algorithms are extensively used to train neural networks, and (2) all the parameters of the networks are tuned iteratively by using such learning algorithms. Unlike these conventional implementations, this paper proposes a new learning algorithm called extreme learning machine (ELM) for single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs) which randomly chooses hidden nodes and analytically determines the output weights of SLFNs. In theory, this algorithm tends to provide good generalization performance at extremely fast learning speed. The experimental results based on a few artificial and real benchmark function approximation and classification problems including very large complex applications show that the new algorithm can produce good generalization performance in most cases and can learn thousands of times faster than conventional popular learning algorithms for feedforward neural networks.11For the preliminary idea of the ELM algorithm, refer to “Extreme Learning Machine: A New Learning Scheme of Feedforward Neural Networks”, Proceedings of International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN2004), Budapest, Hungary, 25–29 July, 2004."

	abstract = {Scientific workflows have emerged as a basic abstraction for structuring and executing scientific experiments in computational environments. In many situations, these workflows are computationally and data intensive, thus requiring execution in large-scale parallel computers. However, parallelization of scientific workflows remains low-level, ad-hoc and laborintensive, which makes it hard to exploit optimization opportunities. To address this problem, we propose an algebraic approach (inspired by relational algebra) and a parallel execution model that enable automatic optimization of scientific workflows. We conducted a thorough validation of our approach using both a real oil exploitation application and synthetic data scenarios. The experiments were run in Chiron, a data-centric scientific workflow engine implemented to support our algebraic approach. Our experiments demonstrate performance improvements of up to 226\% compared to an ad-hoc workflow implementation. © 2011 VLDB Endowment.},

	abstract = {Data preprocessing is a crucial step for mining and learning from data, and one of its primary activities is the transformation of data. This activity is very important in the context of time series prediction since most time series models assume the property of stationarity, i.e., statistical properties do not change over time, which in practice is the exception and not the rule in most real datasets. There are several transformation methods designed to treat nonstationarity in time series. However, the choice of a transformation that is appropriate to the adopted data model and to the problem at hand is not a simple task. This paper provides a review and experimental analysis of methods for transformation of nonstationary time series. The focus of this work is to provide a background on the subject and a discussion on their advantages and limitations to the problem of time series prediction. A subset of the reviewed transformation methods is compared through an experimental evaluation using benchmark datasets from time series prediction competitions and other real macroeconomic datasets. Suitable nonstationary time series transformation methods provided improvements of more than 30\% in prediction accuracy for half of the evaluated time series and improved the prediction in more than 95\% for 10\% of the time series. Furthermore, the adoption of a validation phase during model training enables the selection of suitable transformation methods.},

	abstract = {Extreme environmental events such as droughts affect millions of people all around the world. Although it is not possible to prevent this type of event, its prediction under different time horizons enables the mitigation of eventual damages caused by its occurrence. An important variable for identifying occurrences of droughts is the sea surface temperature (SST). In the tropical Atlantic Ocean, SST data are collected and provided by the Prediction and Research Moored Array in the Tropical Atlantic (PIRATA) project, which is an observation network composed of sensor buoys arranged in this region. Sensors of this type, and more generally Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, commonly lead to data losses that influence the quality of datasets collected for adjusting prediction models. In this paper, we explore the influence of temporal aggregation in predicting step-ahead SST considering different prediction horizons and different sizes for training datasets. We have conducted several experiments using data collected by PIRATA project. Our results point out scenarios for training datasets and prediction horizons indicating whether or not temporal aggregated SST time series may be beneficial for prediction.},

	abstract = {For recent or planned deep astronomical surveys, it is important to tell stars and galaxies apart, a task known as Star/Galaxy Separation Problem (SGSP). At faint magnitudes, the separation between pointy and extended sources is fuzzy, which makes SGSP a hard task. This problem is even harder for large surveys like Dark Energy Survey (DES) and, in a near future, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) due to their large data volume. Hence, the search for classification methods that are both accurate and efficient is highly relevant. In this work, we present a comparative analysis of several machine learning methods targeted at solving the SGSP at faint magnitudes. In order to train the classification models, the COSMOS survey was used. We use machine learning methods as distinct as artificial neural networks, k nearest-neighbor, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests and Naive Bayes. The exploratory process was modeled as data centric workflow. The workflow was implemented on top of Hadoop framework and was used to find the best parameter values for each classification method we considered, of which neural networks and random forest present superior performance. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract="Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.",
